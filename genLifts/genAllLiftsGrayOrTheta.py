"""
Lift construction script with two options:
  1. Lift the Gray graph using (Z_{3},+).
  2. Lift the theta graph (two vertices and 3 parallel edges) using (Z_{15},+).
  
Usage (example):
    python genAllLiftsGrayOrTheta.py --graph-type theta --min-girth 6
    python genAllLiftsGrayOrTheta.py --graph-type gray  --min-girth 10

If --graph-type is "gray", the program uses the Gray graph.
If --graph-type is "theta", the program uses the theta graph.
