# 2-factor parity checker

This repository contains code and data related to the manuscript "Mari√©n Abreu, Jan Goedgebeur, Jorik Jooken, Federico Romaniello, Tibo Van den Eede, The Gray graph is pseudo 2-factor isomorphic, manuscript.". This code allows to check cubic bipartite graphs on being pseudo 2-factor isomorphic or 2-factor hamiltonian. It also contains code to generate all lifts of the Gray graph using the group $`(\mathbb{Z}_3, +)`$ and all lifts of the Theta graph using the group $(\mathbb{Z}_{15}, +)$ in the directory `genLifts`.

## Data

### Gray graph

In the directory `data/grayGraph` one can find data related to the Gray graph, which is pseudo 2-factor isomorphic.

- `adjacency_list.txt` contains the adjacency list of the Gray graph.
- `gray.g6` contains the Gray graph in graph6 format. See [here](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt) for more information on the graph6 format.
- `2-factors.txt` lists the 2-factors of the Gray graph.
- `2-factor_sizes.txt` lists the different sizes of the 2-factors of the Gray graph.
- `perfect_matchings.txt` lists the perfect matchings of the Gray graph.

### Graph lists

The following lists of cubic graphs were checked for the manuscript.

- Cubic arc-transitive graphs up to 10 000 vertices, available [here](https://github.com/tiboat/biregGirthGraphs/tree/main/regToBireg/graph_lists).
- Cubic semi-symmetric graphs up to 10 000 vertices, available [here](https://github.com/tiboat/biregGirthGraphs/tree/main/regToBireg/graph_lists).

- Cubic Cayley graphs up to 5 000 vertices, available [here](https://graphsym.net/). 

## Code

### 2FactorParityChecker

#### Compilation
Compile with the make command.

```
make
```

#### Execution
This helptext can be found by executing `./2FactorParityChecker -h`.

Usage: `./2FactorParityChecker [-l# -n# -N#] [-H -s] [-p | -f | -F] [-h]`


Checks if cubic bipartite graphs are pseudo 2-factor isomorphic or 2-factor hamiltonian.
It reads these cubic graphs in graph6 or sparse6 format from stdin. Input graphs
needs to be cubic, but need not be bipartite; non-bipartite graphs are filtered out.
Output is sent to stdout; error messages are sent to stderr. This
implementation uses parallellization using openmp, so make sure it is
installed.

Underneath are the optional arguments.

    -c, --checkConnectedness
        first check whether the graphs are essentially 4-edge-
        connected. Significantly increases the runtime, so only
        enable this when needed.
    -h, --help
        print this help message
    -H, --hamiltonian
        check if the graphs are 2-factor hamiltonian. When -H
        is not set, it checks if the graph is pseudo 2-factor
        isomorphic.
    -l#, --minLineNumber=#
        only starts testing from the #'th graph received
        from stdin
    -n#, --minOrder=#
        only check the graphs in the input that have at least
        # vertices
    -N#, --maxOrder=#
        only check the graphs in the input that have at most
        # vertices. In case you check graphs with more than
        10 000 vertices, then you need to set this argument!
    -s, --stopFound
        terminate the program as soon as a pseudo 2-factor
        isomorphic / 2-factor hamiltonian graph is found
    -p, --printPerfMatchings
        prints the perfect matchings of the graph
    -f, --print2Factors
        prints the 2-factors of the graph
    -F, --print2FactorSizes
        prints the sizes of the 2-factors of the graph


### genLifts

In the directory `genLifts` one can find code to generate all lifts with a minimum girth of 
- the Gray graph with the group $(\mathbb{Z}_3, +)$ and
- the Theta graph with the group $(\mathbb{Z}_{15}, +)$.

We provide two independent implementations, one written in C++, the other one written in Python. We tested that the C++ implementation and Python implementation obtain the same set of non-isomorphic graph lifts for the Gray graph with girth at least 10 and the Theta graph with girth at least 6.

### C++

#### Compilation

Compile with the following two commands in the directory `genLifts`.

```
g++ -g -std=c++11 -O3 genAllLiftsGray.cpp -o genAllLiftsGrayExecutable
g++ -g -std=c++11 -O3 genAllLiftsTheta.cpp -o genAllLiftsThetaExecutable
```

#### Execution

To obtain the lifts of the Gray graph of girth at least 10 (for instance), run the following command in the directory `genLifts`.

```
./genAllLiftsGrayExecutable 10 < groupZ3.txt 
```

To obtain the lifts of the Theta graph of girth at least 6 (for instance), run the following command in the directory `genLifts`.

```
./genAllLiftsThetaExecutable 6 < groupZ3.txt
```

The files `groupZ3.txt` and `groupZ15.txt` contain data of the groups $`(\mathbb{Z}_3, +)`$ and $(\mathbb{Z}_{15}, +)$, respectively. For each lift found, satisfying the girth condition, an adjacency matrix is printed to stdout. Note that the program does not perform isomorphism rejection, so there can be isomorphic graphs in the output.

***

### Python


Requires no compilation

#### Execution

To obtain the lifts of the Gray graph of girth at least 10 (for instance), run the following command in the directory `genLifts`.

```
python genAllLiftsGrayOrTheta.py --graph-type gray --min-girth 10
```

To obtain the lifts of the Theta graph of girth at least 6 (for instance), run the following command in the directory `genLifts`.

```
python genAllLiftsGrayOrTheta.py --graph-type theta --min-girth 6
```

For each lift found, satisfying the girth condition, the graph6-string of this lift is printed to stdout. Note that the program does not perform isomorphism rejection, so there can be isomorphic graphs in the output.
